# Multi-fidelity-neural-network-
We reproduce four numerical experiments for multi fidelity neural network(pytorch). The first three examples (in function1 file) are for paper: 
1.A composite neural network that learns from multi-fidelity data: Application to function approximation and inverse pde problems.
The last ODE example(ODE file) is for paper 
2. Mohammad Motamed. A multi-fidelity neural network surrogate sampling method for uncertainty quantification. 2019.
